# Context: Custom Notification Plugin

## Goal

Create a world-class, fully customizable notification plugin for Capacitor using Kotlin. The goal is to achieve "supreme innovation" and robustness, comparable to top-tier apps (YouTube, Temu), supporting advanced custom layouts, zero-latency rendering, and flawless reliability across Android versions.

## Scope

- IN:
  - Android (Kotlin) implementation for Capacitor.
  - Custom RemoteViews layout support.
  - Advanced styling (media style, custom actionable buttons, dynamic content updating).
  - Robust channel management.
  - Handling edge cases (background/foreground states, device reboots).
  - "Chinese app" style persistence and engagement optimization (compliant with Android policies but aggressive in reliability).
- OUT:
  - iOS implementation (focusing on Android/Kotlin for now as requested).

## Constraints

- Must be a Capacitor Plugin.
- Must use Kotlin.
- Must adhere to Android Notification best practices while pushing the limits of customization.
- Must handle permission flows gracefully.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks in tasks.md completed
- [ ] Plugin builds successfully
- [ ] Verified on multiple Android API levels
- [ ] Demonstration of custom layout (e.g., media player style) working flawlessly
- [ ] Verification artifacts generated (screenshots/videos of notifications)
