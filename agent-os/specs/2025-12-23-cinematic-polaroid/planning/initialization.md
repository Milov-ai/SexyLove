# Spec Initialization: Cinematic Polaroid Block

## Raw Idea

The user wants a "Cinematic Polaroid" block for the notes app. It should be a functional component that follows the aesthetic of the provided image `polaroid pelis.jpeg`.

Key characteristics from the image:

- Layout: Large movie poster/scene photo at the top.
- Title: Bold, large text followed by the year.
- Details: A structured list of metadata (Genre, Duration, Director, Starring).
- Vibe: Premium, clean, "movie poster" style.

The goal is to integrate this as a new block type in the standard Notes editor (Public Facade), specifically designed for couples to track their movie nights.
