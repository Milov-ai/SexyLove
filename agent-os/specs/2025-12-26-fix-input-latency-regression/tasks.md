- [x] Refactor `NoteEditor.tsx`: Remove `useDebounce` import and hook call to stop per-keystroke renders.
- [x] Refactor `NoteEditor.tsx`: Implement `blocksRef` and `titleRef` to track latest state without triggering re-renders.
- [x] Refactor `NoteEditor.tsx`: Implement `debouncedSave` using `useCallback` and the `debounce` utility, reading strictly from refs.
- [x] Refactor `NoteEditor.tsx`: Update `useEffect` to trigger `debouncedSave` on changes, strictly decoupled from component rendering.
- [x] Harden `NoteEditor.tsx` Hydration: Add `isDirty` ref and prevent external overwrites if user has unsaved changes.
- [/] Verify fix: internal build and strict type check.
