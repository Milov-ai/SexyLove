# Morbo Visual - Verification Checklist

This checklist must be passed before any feature is considered "Done".

## 1. Aesthetic Audit (The "Look")

- [ ] **Dark Mode Integrity:** Are there any pure black (`#000`) or pure gray backgrounds? (Reject if yes. Use `Deep Void`).
- [ ] **Contrast Ratio:** Is the text readable on glass backgrounds?
- [ ] **Glass Quality:** Does the glass effect have the correct blur, border, and noise texture?
- [ ] **Typography:** Are fonts mixed correctly? (Sans for punch, Mono for tech, Serif for soul).
- [ ] **Spacing:** Is there enough whitespace? Does the layout feel cramped?

## 2. Interaction Audit (The "Feel")

- [ ] **Hover States:** Do ALL interactive elements have a hover state?
- [ ] **Active States:** Do buttons "press down" or "ripple" on click?
- [ ] **Focus States:** Are focus rings customized (Glowing) and not default browser rings?
- [ ] **Transitions:** Are page transitions smooth? No flash of unstyled content.
- [ ] **Scroll:** Is scrolling smooth and responsive?

## 3. "Morbo" Factor (The "Soul")

- [ ] **Micro-animations:** Are there subtle movements (floating elements, pulsing glows)?
- [ ] **Loading States:** Are skeletons or loaders designed custom? (No default spinners).
- [ ] **Empty States:** Are empty states designed beautifully, encouraging action?

## 4. Technical Luxury

- [ ] **Console:** Is the console log clean? (No errors, no warnings).
- [ ] **Responsiveness:** Does it work perfectly on Mobile? (Crucial).
- [ ] **Performance:** Is the animation 60fps?
